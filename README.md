# salem.io: a humble site all about me

The site is just hand-coded HTML until it gets more complex, with
[Tachyons][tachyons] for styling.

## how do i do it

```sh
# First, always:
yarn install

# To develop with live-reloading, just run
yarn run dev
# and then visit localhost:8080.

# For a prod build, run
yarn run build
# If you want to see that build in your browser,
yarn run serve
```
